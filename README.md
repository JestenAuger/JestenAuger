<h1>Hi, I'm Jesten! I also go by Jesse</h1>

<br>
<p>I'm a student developper/level desginer studying video game programming with a passion for creating amazing games using C#, C++, Unity and Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>This page is where i will be sharing various projects that I work on both in the video game space as well as other programming related work.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some games I have been involved with making:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHI9iKC531M" target="_blank">Lost</a></li>
  
  <p>Lost was my first gaming project with a team of three people working together. It is a walking simulator and horror game. I and one of the other teammates worked on the visuals. The teammate worked on the maps mostly as did I, but I also worked on the post processing and the placement of the jumpscares and audio queues.</p>
  
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zzviHXsShw" target="_blank">Parallel</a></li>

<p>Parallel is a non euclidian inspired puzzle game that really challenges the players brain. The use of the world being drained of color and only being able to see in black and white helps players see find
and see how to do puzzles when you can see certain colors. All puzzles will be based on the colors you have found allowing you to figure out which piece goes with what puzzle. I was the head game designer on the project. I did all the map design and stylistic look of the game as well. Me and the team worked together to develope and design the puzzles and to come up with the code to get everything to work together. </p>
  
  <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Echos Of Fate</a></li>

<p>Echos of Fate was my latest project, again done in a team, that was a souls like combat game. The game gives you multiple maps have enemies to battle all leading up to a challenging boss fight that really
test your skills in the game. This game was a lot more in depth then we originally planned. I coded the base set of the game, so the health system, the combat system and getting them to work togehter. I then shifted over to main game/level designer again and designed 4 levels. This is entire set up was done in less than 3 months and would have loved to work on it longer to see where it went.
</p>
  
</ul>
<br>
<p>Through these games, I worked on the programming of the games as well as alot of the desgin aspects of the game. I built the maps for Parallel and Echos Of Fate after I finished the base mechanics. These games were very ambious and challenging to do in 3-4 month periods. The end results are something I am very happy with.</p>
<br>
<p>Thank you for taking a look at my page and come back for more updates as I've started to develope my biggest project yet. Will show updates as me and my team continue to work on it.</p>
